Nothin special about the code. Project is about experimenting with various ways to test Ruby code and how to make the tests expressive.

/spec/roman\_numerals_spec.rb holds RSpec tests written at a high level.

test\_roman_numerals.rb holds unit level tests using Ruby's built-in minitest/testunit. 
These both test but function as specs by explaining how roman numerals work.
